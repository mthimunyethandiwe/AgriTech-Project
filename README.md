# AgriTech Project

The AgriTech Project aims to streamline the agricultural supply chain by creating an online marketplace where farmers 
can easily access essential agricultural inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and equipment. This platform connects farmers directly with suppliers,
allowing for seamless transactions without intermediaries. By offering features like product recommendations based on farming needs and reviews from other users,
empowering farmers to make informed purchasing decisions. 
The platform enhances efficiency in agriculture by reducing costs, increasing accessibility to high-quality inputs, and fostering a more transparent, farmer-centric marketplace.
